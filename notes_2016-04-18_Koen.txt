How to make a median-of-25 network

1. Divide the input into 5 groups of 5

2. sort each group, re-arrange the results into 5 groups of 5: SMALL, SMALLISH, MEDIUM, BIGGISH, and BIG.

3. To compute the median, we need:

1. the 2 largest  elements of SMALL
2. the 3 largest  elements of SMALLISH
3. the 3 middle   elements of MEDIUM
4. the 3 smallest elements of BIGGISH
5. the 2 smallest elements of BIG

These can be computed by specialized cut-off sorting networks.

4. Now, we need to merge all of these together. We can use an adaptive generalized odd/even merger a la Mary's for this.
